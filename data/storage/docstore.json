Our first stores in Mexico opened in 2023. We offer a broad selection of\nmerchandise, including consumable items, seasonal items, home products and apparel. Our merchandise includes national\nbrands from leading manufacturers, as well as our own private brand selections with prices at substantial discounts to\nnational brands. We offer our customers these national brand and private brand products at everyday low prices (typically\n$10 or less) in our convenient small-box locations.\nOur History\nJ.L. Turner founded our Company in 1939 as J.L. Turner and Son, Wholesale. We were incorporated as a\nKentucky corporation under the name J.L. Turner & Son, Inc. in 1955, when we opened our first Dollar General store. We\nchanged our name to Dollar General Corporation in 1968 and reincorporated in 1998 as a Tennessee corporation. Our\ncommon stock was publicly traded from 1968 until July 2007, when we merged with an entity controlled by investment\nfunds affiliated with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., or KKR. In November 2009 our common stock again became\npublicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \u201cDG\u201d, and in December 2013 the entity controlled by\ninvestment funds affiliated with KKR sold its remaining shares of our common stock.\nOur Business Model\nOur long history of profitable growth is founded on a commitment to a relatively simple business model:\nproviding a broad base of customers with their basic everyday and household needs, supplemented with a variety of\ngeneral merchandise items, at everyday low prices in conveniently located, small-box stores. We continually evaluate the\nneeds and demands of our customers and modify our merchandise selections and pricing accordingly, while remaining\nfocused on increasing profitability, cash generation and returns for our shareholders.\nOur long-term operating priorities are: 1) driving profitable sales growth, 2) capturing growth opportunities, 3)\nenhancing our position as a low-cost operator, and 4) investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment\nand inclusion.  For more information on these operating priorities, see the \u201cExecutive Overview\u201d section of \nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in Part II, Item 7 of \nthis report. \nWe have achieved positive same-store sales growth each year since 1990, with the exception of 2021 which\nfollowed unusually high sales results in 2020 during the height of the COVID pandemic. We believe that this consistent\ngrowth over many years, which has taken place in a variety of economic conditions, is a result of our compelling value\nand convenience proposition, although no assurances can be given that we will achieve positive same-store sales growth\nin any given year.\nCompelling Value and Convenience Proposition.  Our ability to deliver highly competitive prices in convenient \nlocations and our easy \u201cin and out\u201d shopping format create a compelling shopping experience that we believe \ndistinguishes us from other discount retailers as well as convenience, drug, grocery, online and mass merchant retailers. \nOur slogan \u201cSave time. Save money. Every day!\u201d\u00ae summarizes our appeal to customers.

Our ability to offer everyday low prices on quality merchandise is supported\nby our low-cost operating structure and our strategy to maintain a limited number of items per\nmerchandise category, which we believe helps us maintain strong purchasing power. We offer\nnationally advertised brands at these everyday low prices in addition to offering our own private\nbrands, often at substantially lower prices.\n\u25cf Convenient Locations.  Our stores are conveniently located in a variety of rural, suburban and urban\ncommunities. We seek to locate our stores in close proximity to our customers, which helps drive\ncustomer loyalty and trip frequency and makes us an attractive alternative to large discount and other\nlarge-box retail and grocery stores.\n\u25cf Time-Saving Shopping Experience.  We strive to provide customers with a highly convenient, easy to\nnavigate shopping experience. Our small-box stores are designed to make it easier to get in and out\nquickly, and our digital tools and offerings help drive even greater convenience and additional access\npoints. Our product offering includes most necessities, such as basic packaged and refrigerated or\nfrozen food products, dairy products, cleaning supplies, paper products, health and beauty care items,\ngreeting cards and other stationery items, basic apparel, housewares, hardware and automotive\nsupplies, among others. Our convenient hours and broad merchandise offering allow our customers to\nfulfill their requirements for basic goods and minimize their need to shop elsewhere.\nSubstantial Growth Opportunities.  We believe we have substantial long-term growth potential in the U.S., and \nwe have identified significant opportunities to add new stores, including our pOpshelf concept, in both existing and new \nmarkets. In addition, we have opportunities to relocate, remodel or convert locations within our existing store base to \nbetter serve our customers. Our pOpshelf concept, which we continue to evaluate and evolve, represents an additional \ngrowth opportunity as a unique small-box retail concept that focuses on categories such as seasonal and home d\u00e9cor, \nhealth and beauty, home cleaning supplies, and party and entertainment goods. We have also identified international \nexpansion, with an initial focus on Mexico, as an opportunity for growth. We opened our first Mi S\u00faper Dollar General \nstores in Mexico in 2023 and believe there is additional growth potential in Mexico in the years ahead. Our attractive \nstore economics, including a relatively low initial investment and simple, low-cost operating model, and our variety of \nstore formats have allowed us to grow our store base to current levels and provide us significant opportunities to continue \nour profitable store growth strategy. \nOur Merchandise\nWe offer a focused assortment of everyday necessities, which we believe helps to drive frequent customer visits,\nand key items in a broad range of general merchandise categories. Our product assortment provides the opportunity for\nour customers to address most of their basic shopping needs with one trip. We offer a wide selection of nationally\nadvertised brands from leading manufacturers. Additionally, our private brand products offer even greater value with\noptions to purchase both products that are of comparable quality to national brands as well as opening price point items,\neach often at substantial discounts to the national brands.\nConsumables is our largest merchandise category and includes paper and cleaning products (such as paper\ntowels, bath tissue, paper dinnerware, trash and storage bags, disinfectants, and laundry); packaged food (such as cereals,\npasta, canned soups, canned meats, fruits and vegetables, condiments, spices, sugar and flour); perishables (such as milk,\neggs, bread, refrigerated and frozen food, beer, wine and produce); snacks (such as candy, cookies, crackers, salty snacks\nand carbonated beverages); health and beauty (such as over-the-counter medicines and personal care products including\nsoap, body wash, shampoo, cosmetics, dental hygiene and foot care products); pet (such as pet supplies and pet food); and\ntobacco products.\nSeasonal products include holiday items, toys, batteries, small electronics, greeting cards, stationery, prepaid\nphones and accessories, gardening supplies, hardware, automotive and home office supplies.\nHome products include kitchen supplies, cookware, small appliances, light bulbs, storage containers, frames,\ncandles, craft supplies and kitchen, bed and bath soft goods.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4576, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "36c84e44-3f74-435a-95d0-bbdbe61c1e27": {"__data__": {"id_": "36c84e44-3f74-435a-95d0-bbdbe61c1e27", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "dg_Annual Report.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\eylan\\Documents\\read_pdf\\llama_index_chatbot\\data\\dg_Annual Report.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1442786, "creation_date": "2024-12-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fece0606-2305-487a-8554-2ab79ec6760f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "dg_Annual Report.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\eylan\\Documents\\read_pdf\\llama_index_chatbot\\data\\dg_Annual Report.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1442786, "creation_date": "2024-12-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-30"}, "hash": "7387fdd9bdaf2163772ecc61897b91ba5cba83e83ae634f5036e8d4b8e914b59", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Table of Contents\n7\nApparel includes basic items for infants, toddlers, girls, boys, women and men, as well as socks, underwear,\ndisposable diapers, shoes and accessories.\nThe percentage of net sales of each of our four categories of merchandise for the fiscal years indicated below\nwas as follows:\n    2023     2022     2021  \nConsumables   81.0%   79.7%   76.7%\nSeasonal   10.6%   11.0%   12.2%\nHome products   5.6%   6.2%   6.8%\nApparel   2.8%   3.1%   4.3%\nOur seasonal and home products categories typically account for the highest gross profit margins, and the\nconsumables category typically accounts for the lowest gross profit margin.\nThe Dollar General Store\nThe typical Dollar General store is operated by a store manager, one or more assistant store managers, and three\nor more sales associates.

We lease additional temporary warehouse space as\nnecessary to support our distribution needs. In addition to our traditional distribution centers, we operate multiple\ntemperature-controlled distribution facilities in support of our self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods, such as\ndairy, deli and frozen products. We regularly analyze and rebalance the distribution network with a goal of ensuring that it\nremains efficient and provides the service levels our stores require. See \u201c\u2014Properties\u201d below for additional information\npertaining to our distribution centers.\nMost of our merchandise flows through our distribution centers and is delivered to our stores by our private fleet\nand by third-party trucking firms, utilizing our trailers. In addition, vendors or third-party distributors deliver or ship\ncertain food items and other merchandise directly to our stores.\nSeasonality\nThe nature of our business is somewhat seasonal. Generally, our operating profit has been greater in the fourth\nquarter, which includes the Christmas selling season, as compared with operating profit in each of the first three quarters\nof our fiscal year. In addition, our quarterly results can be affected by the timing of certain holidays, new store openings,\nremodels, relocations, store closings, and weather patterns. See \u201cItem 7.

We compete with discount stores and many other\nretailers, including mass merchandise, warehouse club, grocery, drug, convenience, variety, online, and certain specialty\nstores. These other retail companies operate stores in many of the areas where we operate, and many of them engage in\nextensive advertising and marketing efforts. Our direct competitors include Family Dollar, Dollar Tree, Big Lots, 99\nCents Only and various local, independent operators, as well as Walmart, Target, Kroger, Aldi, Walgreens, CVS, and Rite\nAid, among others. Certain of our competitors have greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we\ndo and may be able to secure better arrangements from suppliers than we can. Competition is intense and we believe it\nwill continue to be so, with certain competitors reducing their store locations while others move into or increase their\npresence in our geographic and product markets and increase the availability of mobile, web-based and other digital\ntechnology to facilitate a more convenient and competitive online and in-store customer shopping experience.\nWe believe that we differentiate ourselves from other forms of retailing by offering competitive prices in a\nconvenient, small-store format. We are able to maintain competitive prices due in part to our low-cost operating structure\nand the relatively limited assortment of products offered. Purchasing large volumes of merchandise within our focused\nassortment in each merchandise category allows us to keep our average product costs low, contributing to our ability to\noffer competitive everyday low prices to our customers.

You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other\ninformation in this report and other filings that we make from time to time with the SEC, including our consolidated\nfinancial statements and accompanying notes. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. These risks are not the only risks we face. Our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations or liquidity could also be adversely affected by additional factors that apply to all\ncompanies generally or by risks not currently known to us or that we currently view to be immaterial. We can provide no\nassurance and make no representation that our risk mitigation efforts, although we believe they are reasonable, will be\nsuccessful.\nBusiness, Strategic and Competitive Risks\nEconomic factors may reduce our customers\u2019 spending, impair our ability to execute our strategies and\ninitiatives, and increase our costs and expenses, which could result in materially decreased sales and/or profitability.\nMany of our customers have fixed or low incomes and limited discretionary spending dollars. Any factor that\ncould adversely affect their disposable income could decrease our customers\u2019 spending or cause them to shift their\nspending to our lower margin product choices, which could result in materially decreased sales and/or profitability.\nFactors that could reduce, and in many cases have reduced, our customers\u2019 disposable income include but are not limited\nto high unemployment or underemployment levels or decline in real wages; inflation; pandemics (such as the COVID-19\npandemic); higher fuel, energy, healthcare, housing and product costs; higher interest rates, consumer debt levels, and tax\nrates; lack of available credit; tax law changes that negatively affect credits and refunds; and decreases in, or elimination\nof, government assistance programs or subsidies such as unemployment and food/nutrition assistance programs, student\nloan repayment forgiveness and economic stimulus payments.\nMany of the economic factors listed above, as well as commodity rates; transportation, lease and insurance costs;\nwage rates (including the heightened possibility of increased federal and further increased state and/or local minimum\nwage rates); foreign exchange rate fluctuations; measures that create barriers to or increase the costs of international trade\n(including increased import duties or tariffs); changes in applicable laws and regulations (including tax laws related to the\ncorporate tax rate); and other economic factors, also could impair our ability to successfully execute our strategies and\ninitiatives, as well as increase our cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expenses (including real\nestate costs), and may have other adverse consequences that we are unable to fully anticipate or control, all of which may\nmaterially decrease our sales or profitability.\nInflation in the United States rose significantly in 2022, primarily believed to be the result of the economic\nimpacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, and although it moderated in 2023, it remains elevated in certain areas, including\nfood. If food (and in particular, \u201cfood at home\u201d) inflation continues to increase, we may not be able to adjust prices\nsufficiently to offset the effect without negatively impacting customer demand or our gross margin. Additionally, to the\nextent that these inflationary pressures result in a recessionary environment, we may experience material adverse effects\non our business, results of operations and cash flows. For more information, see the \u201cExecutive Overview\u201d section of\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in Part II, Item 7 of\nthis report.\nOur plans depend significantly on strategies, initiatives and investments designed to increase sales and\nprofitability and improve the efficiencies, costs and effectiveness of our operations, and failure to achieve or sustain\nthese plans could materially affect our results of operations.\nWe have short-term and long-term strategies, initiatives and investments (such as those relating to\nmerchandising, real estate and new store development, international expansion, store formats and concepts, digital,\nmarketing, shrink, damages, sourcing, private brand, inventory management, supply chain, private fleet, store operations,\nexpense reduction, and technology) in various stages of testing, evaluation, and implementation, which are designed to\ncontinue to improve our results of operations and financial condition.

The number and diverse geographic locations of our stores and distribution centers\nand our decentralized field management also contribute to the challenging nature of these factors. Other risk factors\ndescribed herein also could negatively affect general implementation. Failure to achieve successful or cost-effective\nimplementation of our initiatives could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nThe success of our merchandising initiatives, particularly those related to non-consumable products (including \nour pOpshelf concept) and efforts to increase sales of higher margin products within the consumables category, further \ndepends in part upon our ability to accurately predict the products that our customers will demand and to accurately \nidentify and timely respond to evolving trends in consumer preferences and demographic mixes in our markets. If we are \nunable to select and timely obtain products that are attractive to customers and at costs that allow us to sell them at an \nacceptable profit, or to effectively market such products, it could result in materially decreased sales and profitability. \nDespite these initiatives, our sales mix continued to shift from non-consumables toward consumables in 2023, and our \nconsumables sales as a percentage of total sales is currently at historical highs. Additionally, factors negatively affecting \nour customers\u2019 disposable income can have (and we believe recently have had) a larger negative impact on non-\nconsumables sales results than consumables sales results and on our pOpshelf concept.  \nThe success of our self-checkout option in our stores depends in part on successful acquisition, implementation \nand maintenance of the necessary hardware and new point of sale software, continued customer interest in and adoption \nof self-checkout and our ability to gain cost efficiencies and control shrink levels from self-checkout. To address shrink \nchallenges presented by self-checkout as well as to enhance the overall customer and employee experience in our stores, \nwe are revising our self-checkout strategy, including limiting self-checkout to transactions of five items or fewer, \nconverting all or some self-checkout registers in approximately 9,000 stores to assisted checkout options, and removing \nself-checkout from approximately 300 stores.  \nThe success of DG Media Network, which is our platform for connecting brand partners with our customers to\ndrive even greater value for each, further depends on our ability to successfully gather target customer audiences that\ndeliver consistent, predictable and beneficial returns on advertising spending to generate interest and demand from our\nbrand partners, as well as to properly handle and secure all sensitive customer data.\nWe face intense competition that could limit our growth opportunities and materially and adversely affect our \nresults of operations and financial condition.  \nThe retail business is highly competitive with respect to price, customers, store location, merchandise quality, \nproduct assortment and presentation, service offerings, product sourcing and supply chain capacity, in-stock consistency, \ncustomer service, ease of shopping experience (including but not limited to various modes of shopping, including online \nalternatives), promotional activity, employees, and market share. We compete with discount stores and many other \nretailers, including mass merchandise, warehouse club, grocery, drug, convenience, variety, online retailers, and certain \nspecialty stores. To maintain our competitive position, we may be required to lower prices, either temporarily or \npermanently, and may have limited ability to increase prices in response to increased costs, resulting in lower margins and \nreduced profitability.  Certain of our competitors have greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources, and \nmay be able to secure better arrangements with suppliers, than we. \nCompetition is intense, and is expected to continue to be so, with certain competitors reducing their store\nlocations while others enter or increase their presence in our geographic and product markets (including through the\nexpansion of availability of delivery services) and expand availability of mobile, web-based and other digital technologies\nto facilitate a more convenient and competitive online and in-store shopping experience. We currently do not offer online\nshopping to a significant degree and have seen a greater willingness of our customers to adopt online shopping. In\naddition, if our competitors or others were to enter our industry in a significant way, including through alliances or other\nbusiness combinations, it could significantly alter the competitive dynamics of the retail marketplace and result in\ncompetitors with greatly improved competitive positions, which could materially affect our financial performance. Our\nability to effectively compete will depend substantially upon our continued ability to develop and execute compelling and\ncost-effective strategies and initiatives.

Our ability to\ntimely open, relocate and remodel profitable stores and expand into additional market areas is a key component of our\nplanned future growth and may depend in part on: the availability of suitable store locations and capital funding; the\nabsence of entitlement process, permitting or occupancy delays, including zoning restrictions and moratoria on small box\ndiscount retail development such as those passed by certain local governments in areas where we operate or seek to \noperate; supply chain volatility resulting in delivery delays, and in some cases, lack of availability of store equipment, \nbuilding materials, and store merchandise for resale; the ability to negotiate acceptable lease and development terms (for \nexample, real estate development requirements and cost of building materials and labor), to cost-effectively hire and train \nqualified new personnel, especially store managers, and to identify and accurately assess sufficient customer demand; and \ngeneral economic conditions. While we continued to experience certain of these factors at heightened levels in 2023, to \ndate, they have not materially impaired our ability to complete our planned real estate projects or growth, and thus, have \nnot had a material adverse effect on our financial performance.  However, if the levels which we have experienced \nescalate or remain elevated for an extended period of time, we expect that they could have a material adverse effect on \nour ability to complete our future planned real estate projects or growth, and in turn, a material adverse effect on our \nfinancial performance. Both inflation and higher interest rates have significantly increased new store opening costs and \noccupancy costs, which have negatively impacted our projected new store returns and influenced our 2024 new store \ngrowth plans. \nWe also may not anticipate or successfully address all of the challenges imposed by the expansion of our\noperations (including our pOpshelf store concept), including into new countries or domestic markets, states or urban or\nsuburban areas where we have limited or no meaningful experience or brand recognition. Those areas may have different\nregulatory environments, competitive and market conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than\nour existing markets, as well as higher cost of entry and operating costs. These factors may cause our new stores to be less\nprofitable than stores in our existing markets, which could slow future growth in these areas. In addition, many new stores\nwill be located in areas where we have existing stores, which inadvertently may temporarily or permanently divert a\nlarger than anticipated number of customers and sales from our existing stores, thereby adversely affecting our overall\nfinancial performance.\nInventory shrinkage and damages may negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe experience significant inventory shrinkage and damages. Although some level of inventory shrinkage and\ndamages is an unavoidable cost of doing business, higher rates of inventory shrinkage and damages or increased security\nmeasures or other costs to combat inventory theft could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nDuring 2023, our inventory shrink and damages results remained significantly elevated and materially impacted our\nresults. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to contain or reduce inventory shrinkage and\ndamages.\nOur cash flows from operations, profitability and financial condition may be negatively affected if we are not\nsuccessful in managing our inventory balances.\nOur inventory balance represented approximately 49% of our total assets exclusive of goodwill, operating lease\nassets, and other intangible assets as of February 2, 2024.

If we do not accurately predict customer trends, spending levels, or price sensitivity, we may have to take \nunanticipated markdowns to dispose of the excess inventory, which also can adversely affect our financial results.  Our \npOpshelf concept is particularly susceptible to this risk as it is reliant upon accurate customer trend prediction and the \nlevel of customers\u2019 disposable income.

Such systems are subject to damage or interruption from power surges and outages, facility damage, physical\ntheft, computer and telecommunications failures, inadequate or ineffective redundancy, malicious code (including\nmalware, ransomware, or similar), successful attacks (e.g., account compromise; phishing; denial of service; and\napplication, network or system vulnerability exploitation), software upgrade failures or code defects, natural disasters and\nhuman error. Due to the political tensions involving China, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the conflict in\nthe Middle East, there is an increased likelihood that escalation of tensions could result in cyberattacks that could either\ndirectly or indirectly impact our operations. Design defects, damage to, or interruption to these systems may require a\nsignificant investment to repair or replace, disrupt our operations and affect our ability to meet business and reporting\nrequirements, result in the loss or corruption of critical data, and harm our reputation, all of which could materially and\nadversely affect our business or results of operations.\nOur technology initiatives may not deliver desired results or may do so on a delayed schedule.

In addition, distribution-related construction or expansion projects entail risks\nthat could cause delays and cost overruns, such as: availability of temperature-controlled distribution centers and\nrefrigerated transportation equipment; shortages of materials or skilled labor; work stoppages; unforeseen construction,\nscheduling, engineering, environmental or geological problems; weather interference; fires or other casualty losses; and\nunanticipated cost increases. For these reasons, the completion date and ultimate cost of these projects could differ\nsignificantly from initial expectations, and we cannot guarantee that any project will be completed on time or within\nestablished budgets.\nRisks associated with or faced by our suppliers could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe source our merchandise from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers, and we depend on them\nto supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner and in the large volumes that we may require. In 2023, our two\nlargest suppliers accounted for approximately 10% and 8% respectively, of our purchases. If one or more of our current\nsources of supply became unavailable, we believe we generally would be able to obtain alternative sources, but it could\nincrease our merchandise costs and supply chain lead time and expenses, result in a temporary reduction in store\ninventory levels, and reduce the selection and quality of our merchandise. An inability to obtain alternative sources could\nmaterially decrease our sales. Additionally, if a supplier fails to deliver on its commitments, we could experience\nmerchandise out-of-stocks that could lead to lost sales and reputational harm. Further, failure of suppliers to meet our\ncompliance protocols could prolong our procurement lead time, resulting in lost sales and adverse margin impact.\nWe directly imported approximately 4% of our purchases (measured at cost) in 2023, but many of our domestic\nvendors directly import their products or components of their products. Changes to the prices and flow of these goods\noften are for reasons beyond our control, such as political or civil unrest, acts of war, disruptive global political events\n(for example, political tensions involving China, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle\nEast), currency fluctuations, disruptions in maritime lanes, port labor disputes, economic conditions and instability in\ncountries in which foreign suppliers are located, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers\u2019 failure to meet our terms\nand conditions or our standards, issues with our suppliers\u2019 labor practices or labor problems they may experience (such as\nstrikes, stoppages or slowdowns, which could also increase labor costs during and following the disruption), the\navailability and cost of raw materials, pandemic outbreaks, merchandise quality or safety issues, transport availability and\ncost, increases in wage rates and taxes, transport security, inflation, and other factors relating to suppliers and the\ncountries in which they are located or from which they import. Such changes could adversely affect our operations and\nprofitability.\nWhile we are working to diversify our sources of imported goods to include Southeast Asia, India, South\nAmerica and Mexico, a substantial amount of our imported merchandise comes from China, and thus, a change in the\nChinese leadership, the effects of pandemic outbreaks, economic and market conditions, internal economic stimulus\nactions, or currency or other policies, as well as trade and other relations between China and the United States and\nincreases in costs of labor, could negatively impact our merchandise costs. In addition, the United States\u2019 foreign trade\npolicies, duties (which increased on certain products imported from China and Southeast Asian countries in 2023), tariffs\nand other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries (particularly China) and entities,\nimport limitations on certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other\nfactors relating to foreign trade and port labor agreements are beyond our control. These and other factors affecting our\nsuppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our business and financial performance.

These events may also increase the costs of\ninsurance if they result in significant loss of property or other insurable damage or loss by us or in the market more\ngenerally.\nFurthermore, the long-term impacts of global climate change present the possibility of both physical risks (such \nas extreme weather conditions or rising sea levels) and transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes), which \nmay be widespread and unpredictable. Over time, these changes, as well as regulatory efforts related thereto, could affect, \nfor example, the availability and cost of products, commodities and energy (including utilities), which in turn may impact \nour ability to procure goods and services required for the operation of our businesses at the quantities and levels and at the \ncosts we require. In addition, our operations and facilities may be located in areas impacted by the physical risks of \nclimate change, and we face the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to stores, distribution centers, or our \ncorporate offices, as well as loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by such events. We also use \nnatural gas, diesel fuel, gasoline and electricity in our operations, all of which could face increased regulation relating to \nclimate change or other environmental concerns.  Regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions and energy inputs may \nalso increase in coming years, which may increase our costs associated with compliance and merchandise purchases. \nThese events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and could materially adversely \naffect our financial performance. \nProduct liability, product recall or other product safety or labeling claims could adversely affect our business,\nreputation and financial performance.\nWe depend on our vendors to ensure that the products we buy from them comply with applicable product safety\nand labeling laws and regulations and to inform us of all applicable restrictions on the sale of such products.

However, there are types of losses we may incur but against which we\ncannot be insured or which we believe are not economically reasonable to insure, such as losses due to acts of war, certain\ncrimes (including employee crime), certain wage and hour and other employment-related claims and litigation, actions\nbased on certain consumer protection laws, and some natural and other disasters (including, without limitation, fires and\nfloods) or similar events. If we incur material uninsured losses, our financial performance could be negatively impacted.\nCertain material events have resulted, and may result again in the future, in sizable losses for the insurance industry and\nadversely affect the availability of adequate insurance coverage or result in excessive premium increases. To offset\nnegative insurance market trends, we may elect to self-insure, accept higher deductibles or reduce the amount of\ncoverage. In addition, we self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers\u2019 compensation, auto\nliability, general liability (including claims made against certain of our landlords), property loss, and group health\ninsurance programs. Significant changes in actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our recorded\nliabilities for these losses, including any expected increases in medical and indemnity costs, could result in materially\ndifferent expenses than expected under these programs, which could materially and adversely affect our results of\noperations and financial condition. Although we maintain property insurance to cover insurable losses resulting from, for\nexample, fires and storms, at our store support center and distribution centers, we are effectively self-insured for other\nproperty losses. If we experience a greater number of these self-insured losses than we anticipate, our financial\nperformance could be adversely affected.\nFailure to attract, develop and retain qualified employees while controlling labor costs, as well as other labor\nissues, including employee safety issues, could adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur future growth and performance, positive customer experience and legal and regulatory compliance depends\non our ability to attract, develop, retain and motivate qualified employees while operating in an industry that has\nhistorically been challenged by high rates of employee turnover. Our ability to meet our labor needs, while controlling our\nlabor costs, is subject to many external factors, including competition for and availability of qualified personnel,\nunemployment levels, wage rates and salary levels (including the heightened possibility of increased federal and further\nincreased state and/or local minimum wage rates/salary levels), health and other insurance costs, changes in employment\nand labor laws or other workplace regulations (including those relating to employee benefit programs such as health\ninsurance and paid leave programs), employee activism, employee safety issues, employee expectations and productivity,\nand our reputation and relevance within the labor market. If we are unable to attract, develop and retain adequate numbers\nof qualified employees, our operations, customer service levels, legal and regulatory compliance, and support functions\ncould suffer. In addition, to the extent a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, or attempts to unionize, our\nlabor and other costs could increase, and it is possible that federal agencies may adopt or impose regulatory or other\nchanges to existing law that could facilitate union organizing or otherwise restrict employer actions. Further, anticipated\nregulatory changes relating to the overtime exemptions under the Fair Labor Standards Act (in particular, the\nexecutive/managerial exemption) could result in increased labor costs to our business and negatively affect our operating\nresults if changes to our business operations are required.

Moreover, the \nadoption of new environmental laws and regulations in connection with climate change and the transition to a low carbon \neconomy, including any federal or state laws enacted to regulate greenhouse gas emissions or require public disclosures \nrelated thereto (including the recently adopted SEC rules requiring certain disclosures relating to climate change), could \nsignificantly increase our operating or merchandise costs or reduce the demand for our products.  These laws and \nregulations may include, but are not limited to, requirements relating to hazardous waste materials, recycling and \nrecycled/recyclable product content, single-use plastics, extended producer responsibility, use of refrigerants, carbon \npricing or carbon taxes, product energy efficiency standards and product labeling.

We offer our customers these national brand and private brand\nproducts at everyday low prices (typically $10 or less) in our convenient small-box locations.\nWe believe our convenient store formats, locations, and broad selection of high-quality products at compelling\nvalues have driven our substantial growth and financial success over the years and through a variety of economic cycles.\nWe are mindful that the majority of our customers are value-conscious, and many have low and/or fixed incomes. As a\nresult, we are intensely focused on helping our customers make the most of their spending dollars. Our customers\ncontinue to feel constrained in the current macroeconomic environment, and accordingly we expect their spending to\ncontinue to be pressured, particularly in our non-consumables categories. Our core customers are often among the first to\nbe affected by negative or uncertain economic conditions and among the last to feel the effects of improving economic\nconditions, particularly when trends are inconsistent and of an uncertain duration. The primary macroeconomic factors\nthat affect our core customers include unemployment and underemployment rates, inflation, wage growth, changes in\nU.S. and global trade policy, and changes in U.S. government policy and assistance programs (including cost of living\nadjustments), such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (\u201cSNAP\u201d), unemployment benefits, and economic\nstimulus programs. Our customers were impacted by the elimination of the emergency allotment of SNAP benefits and\nlower tax refunds resulting from the elimination of COVID-related stimulus programs, each of which occurred in the first\nquarter of 2023, and continue to be impacted by the overall macroeconomic environment. Additionally, our customers\ncontinue to experience higher expenses that generally comprise a large portion of their household budgets, such as rent,\nhealthcare, energy and fuel prices, as well as cost inflation in frequently purchased household products (including food).\nIn addition, the Department of Education\u2019s COVID-19 pandemic student loan forbearance program ended in September\n2023, and payment obligations generally resumed in October 2023. The impact of this program\u2019s conclusion on our\ncustomer and our business has not been material, although we can make no assurance that it will not be material in the\nfuture. Finally, significant unseasonable or unusual weather patterns or extreme weather can impact customer shopping\nbehaviors, although we did not identify any such impact to any significant degree in 2023.\nWe remain committed to our long-term operating priorities as we consistently strive to improve our performance\nwhile retaining our customer-centric focus. These priorities include: 1) driving profitable sales growth, 2) capturing\ngrowth opportunities, 3) enhancing our position as a low-cost operator, and 4) investing in our diverse teams through\ndevelopment, empowerment and inclusion.\nWe seek to drive profitable sales growth through initiatives aimed at increasing customer traffic and average\ntransaction amount. Historically, sales in our consumables category, which tend to have lower gross margins, have been\nthe key drivers of net sales and customer traffic, while sales in our non-consumables categories, which tend to have higher\ngross margins, have contributed to more profitable sales growth and an increase in average transaction amount.

Certain of our initiatives are intended to address this sales mix trend; however, there can be no assurances that\nthese efforts will be successful.\nAs we work to provide everyday low prices and meet our customers\u2019 affordability needs, we remain focused on\nenhancing our margins through inventory shrink and damage reduction initiatives, as well as pricing and markdown\noptimization, effective category management and inventory reduction efforts, distribution and transportation efficiencies,\nprivate brands penetration and global sourcing. Several of our strategic and other sales-driving initiatives are also\ndesigned to capture growth opportunities and are discussed in more detail below.\nWe experienced higher damages in the first half of 2023, as well as significantly higher shrink throughout 2023. \nWe believe that our shrink results in 2023 were due to a number of factors, including materially higher inventory levels in \nthe first half of the year, store standards and other operational challenges such as self-checkout and store manager \nturnover, as well as the macroeconomic environment. As of fiscal year-end, and discussed further below, we have \nmaterially reduced inventory levels. To address challenges presented by self-checkout as well as to enhance the overall \ncustomer and associate experience in our stores, we are revising our self-checkout strategy, including limiting self-\ncheckout to transactions of five items or fewer, converting some or all self-checkout registers in approximately 9,000 \nstores to assisted checkout options, and removing self-checkout from approximately 300 stores. As discussed further \nbelow, we also have invested in retail labor to help drive improved store standards and have plans in place to improve \nstore manager turnover rates.  \nWe continue to implement and invest in certain strategic initiatives that we believe will help drive profitable\nsales growth with both new and existing customers and capture long-term growth opportunities. Such opportunities\ninclude providing our customers with a variety of shopping access points and even greater value and convenience by\nleveraging and developing digital tools and technology, such as our Dollar General app, which contains a variety of tools\nto enhance the in-store shopping experience. Additionally, our partnership with a third-party delivery service is available\nin the majority of our stores, and we continue to grow our DG Media Network, which is our platform for connecting\nbrand partners with our customers to drive even greater value for each.\nFurther, we are continuing to evaluate and evolve the pOpshelf concept, including expanding at a more measured\npace in the softer discretionary sales environment, as well as converting some locations to Dollar General store locations.\npOpshelf is a unique retail concept focused on categories such as seasonal and home d\u00e9cor, health and beauty, home\ncleaning supplies, and party and entertainment goods. At the end of 2023, we operated 216 standalone pOpshelf locations.\nOur \u201cDG Fresh\u201d initiative, a self-distribution model for frozen and refrigerated products that is designed to\nreduce product costs, enhance item assortment, improve our in-stock position, and enhance sales, has positively\ncontributed to our sales and gross margin performance since we completed the initial rollout in 2021. Moving forward, we\nplan to focus on additional optimization of the distribution footprint and product assortment within DG Fresh with the\ngoal to further drive profitable sales growth.\nWe also remain focused on capturing growth opportunities. In 2023, we opened a total of 987 new stores,\nincluding our first three stores in Mexico, remodeled 2,007 stores, and relocated 129 stores. In fiscal 2024, we plan to\nopen approximately 800 new stores (including any new pOpshelf stores or stores in Mexico), remodel approximately\n1,500 stores, and relocate approximately 85 stores, for a total of 2,385 real estate projects.\nWe expect store format innovation to allow us to capture additional growth opportunities within our existing\nmarkets as we continue to utilize the most productive of our various Dollar General store formats based on the specific\nmarket opportunity. We are using two larger format stores (approximately 8,500 square feet and 9,500 square feet,\nrespectively), and consistent with 2023, expect the 8,500 square foot format, along with our existing Dollar General Plus\nformat of a similar size, to continue as our base prototypes for the majority of new stores in 2024, replacing our\ntraditional 7,300 square foot format and higher-cooler count Dollar General Traditional Plus format.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4682, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5543e85e-af3a-43bb-863d-e654e5238c66": {"__data__": {"id_": "5543e85e-af3a-43bb-863d-e654e5238c66", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "dg_Annual Report.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\eylan\\Documents\\read_pdf\\llama_index_chatbot\\data\\dg_Annual Report.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1442786, "creation_date": "2024-12-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c1d3f1cd-cf56-4b54-a082-40d6db9031d9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "dg_Annual Report.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\eylan\\Documents\\read_pdf\\llama_index_chatbot\\data\\dg_Annual Report.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1442786, "creation_date": "2024-12-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-30"}, "hash": "9e88cac051e0d8a6a1d5eacd0df7988029a99554e0575e46887a2a00b7544a18", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b27abe43-30ca-4720-a16c-303d5c929552", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "dg_Annual Report.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\eylan\\Documents\\read_pdf\\llama_index_chatbot\\data\\dg_Annual Report.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1442786, "creation_date": "2024-12-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-30"}, "hash": "3add24518b1086ef4ec2e0a726ec98ccc52a1045b3c4448af3919338349f3a4d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "We expect store format innovation to allow us to capture additional growth opportunities within our existing\nmarkets as we continue to utilize the most productive of our various Dollar General store formats based on the specific\nmarket opportunity.

We plan to continue enhancing this position over time while employing\nongoing cost discipline to reduce certain expenses as a percentage of sales. Nonetheless, we seek to maintain flexibility to\ninvest in the business as necessary to enhance our long-term competitiveness and profitability. From time to time, our\nstrategic initiatives, including without limitation those discussed above, have required and may continue to require us to\nincur upfront expenses for which there may not be an immediate return in terms of sales or enhanced profitability.\nTo further optimize our cost structure and facilitate greater operational control within our supply chain, we\nfurther expanded our private fleet in 2023 from 1,600 tractors at the end of fiscal 2022 to more than 2,000 tractors at the\nend of 2023, representing the majority of all outbound trucks delivering from our distribution centers.\nCertain of our operating expenses, such as wage rates and occupancy costs, have continued to increase in recent\nyears, due primarily to market forces such as labor availability, increases in minimum wage rates and increases in\nproperty rents and interest rates. Further, significant and/or rapid increases to federal and further increases to state and/or\nlocal minimum wage rates/salary levels could adversely affect our earnings if we are not able to otherwise offset these\nincreased labor costs elsewhere in our business. Furthermore, in 2023 we invested approximately $150 million in retail\nlabor, primarily through labor hours, to further enhance our store standards, including on-shelf availability, and\ncompliance efforts as well as the customer and associate experience in our stores.\nIn addition to the labor investment in 2023, we took additional actions to support our customers, stores and\ndistribution centers. Most significantly, we accelerated the pace of our inventory reduction efforts, including additional\npromotional markdowns, in an effort to return to more optimal inventory levels sooner than we believed the current pace\nwould deliver. These investments in retail labor, markdowns, and other areas, had a materially negative impact on our\noperating profit in 2023.\nWhile we believe the overall growth rate of inflation has moderated, we expect some inflationary pressures will\ncontinue to affect our operating results and our vendors and customers. Moreover, increases in market interest rates have\nhad, and will likely continue to have, a negative impact on our interest expense, both with respect to issuances of\ncommercial paper notes, if any, and other indebtedness. Further, both inflation and higher interest rates have significantly\nincreased new store opening costs and occupancy costs, and while we continue to have strong new store returns and grow\nour store base significantly in 2024, these increased costs have negatively impacted our projected new store returns and\ninfluenced our 2024 new store growth plans.\nOur diverse teams are a competitive advantage, and we proactively seek ways to continue investing in their\ndevelopment. Our goal is to create an environment that attracts, develops, and retains talented personnel, particularly at\nthe store manager level, because employees who are promoted from within our company generally have longer tenures\nand are greater contributors to improvements in our financial performance. We are taking actions designed to reduce our\nstore manager turnover, which was higher than targeted in 2023, including through our labor investment and allocation of\nlabor hours, simplifying in-store activities, and reducing excess inventory.\nTo further enhance shareholder returns, we have continued to pay quarterly cash dividends. The declaration and\namount of future dividends are subject to Board discretion and approval, although we currently expect to continue paying\nquarterly cash dividends. As planned, to preserve our investment grade credit rating and maintain financial flexibility, we\ndid not repurchase any shares during 2023 under our share repurchase program and do not plan to repurchase shares\nduring 2024.

Furthermore, the seasonal nature of our business may affect comparisons between periods.\nThe following table contains results of operations data for fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, and the dollar and\npercentage variances among those years.\n2023 vs. 2022  2022 vs. 2021(amounts in millions, except           Amount   %   Amount   %per share amounts) 2023 2022 2021 Change Change Change Change\nNet sales by category:\nConsumables $ 31,342.6$ 30,155.2$ 26,258.6$ 1,187.4  3.9%  $ 3,896.6 14.8% \n% of net sales   81.01%    79.68%    76.73%   \nSeasonal   4,083.8   4,182.8   4,182.2   (99.0) (2.4)   0.6  0.0\n% of net sales   10.55%    11.05%    12.22%   \nHome products   2,163.8   2,332.4   2,322.4   (168.6) (7.2)   10.0  0.4\n% of net sales   5.59%    6.16%    6.79%   \nApparel   1,101.4   1,174.4   1,457.3   (73.0) (6.2)   (282.9) (19.4)\n% of net sales   2.85%    3.10%    4.26%   \nNet sales $ 38,691.6$ 37,844.9$ 34,220.4$  846.7  2.2%  $ 3,624.4 10.6% \nCost of goods sold   26,972.6  26,024.8  23,407.4  947.8  3.6   2,617.3 11.2\n% of net sales   69.71%    68.77%    68.40%   \nGross profit   11,719.0   11,820.1   10,813.0  (101.1) (0.9)   1,007.1  9.3\n% of net sales   30.29%    31.23%    31.60%   \nSelling, general and administrative\nexpenses   9,272.7   8,491.8   7,592.3   780.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2184, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5578396c-7e2f-42e2-bb7d-562445b716d7": {"__data__": {"id_": "5578396c-7e2f-42e2-bb7d-562445b716d7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "dg_Annual Report.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\eylan\\Documents\\read_pdf\\llama_index_chatbot\\data\\dg_Annual Report.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1442786, "creation_date": "2024-12-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4edf0220-b830-4f54-8737-ed16edef7825", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "dg_Annual Report.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\eylan\\Documents\\read_pdf\\llama_index_chatbot\\data\\dg_Annual Report.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1442786, "creation_date": "2024-12-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-30"}, "hash": "434e22de19278647f017706ba44df028bffb4b2694216261aaf71f3c98c86977", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "826c1d1d-d731-4ff1-a4e5-54bef525d6d6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "dg_Annual Report.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\eylan\\Documents\\read_pdf\\llama_index_chatbot\\data\\dg_Annual Report.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1442786, "creation_date": "2024-12-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-30"}, "hash": "25534011e000424f1768e6c45b7353b512c40d28993ced4e9538b0c0625362e5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "8  23,407.4  947.8  3.6   2,617.3 11.2\n% of net sales   69.71%    68.77%    68.40%   \nGross profit   11,719.0   11,820.1   10,813.0  (101.1) (0.9)   1,007.1  9.3\n% of net sales   30.29%    31.23%    31.60%   \nSelling, general and administrative\nexpenses   9,272.7   8,491.8   7,592.3   780.9  9.2   899.5  11.8\n% of net sales   23.97%    22.44%    22.19%   \nOperating profit   2,446.3   3,328.3   3,220.7   (882.0) (26.5)   107.6  3.3\n% of net sales   6.32%    8.79%    9.41%   \nInterest expense   326.8   211.3   157.5   115.5  54.7   53.7  34.1\n% of net sales   0.84%    0.56%    0.46%   \nOther (income) expense   \u2014   0.4   \u2014   (0.4)  \u2014   0.4  \u2014\n% of net sales   0.00%    0.00%    0.00%   \nIncome before income taxes   2,119.5   3,116.6   3,063.1   (997.1) (32.0)   53.5  1.7\n% of net sales   5.48%    8.24%    8.95%   \nIncome tax expense   458.2   700.6   663.9   (242.4) (34.6)   36.7  5.5\n% of net sales   1.18%    1.85%    1.94%   \nNet income $  1,661.3 $  2,416.0 $  2,399.2 $  (754.7) (31.2)%  $  16.8  0.7% \n% of net sales   4.29%    6.38%    7.01%   \nDiluted earnings per share $  7.55 $  10.68 $  10.17 $  (3.13) (29.3)%  $  0.51  5.0% \nNet Sales.

The increase in same-store sales reflects an increase in customer traffic, partially offset by a\ndecrease in the average transaction amount. The decrease in average transaction amount was driven by a decline in items\nper transaction, partially offset by higher average item retail prices.

The increase in same-store sales reflects an\nincrease in average transaction amount which was driven by higher average item retail prices as a result of higher\ninflation, partially offset by a decline in customer traffic. Same-store sales increased in the consumables category, and\ndeclined in the apparel, seasonal, and home products categories. In 2022, our 17,886 same-stores accounted for sales of\n$35.3 billion.\nGross Profit. In 2023, gross profit decreased by 0.9%, and as a percentage of net sales decreased by 94 basis\npoints to 30.3% compared to 2022, primarily driven by increased shrink and inventory markdowns, lower inventory\nmarkups, a higher proportion of lower margin consumables sales, and increased damages. Partially offsetting the factors\nwhich decreased our overall gross profit rate were a lower LIFO provision and decreased transportation costs.\nIn 2022, gross profit increased by 9.3%, and as a percentage of net sales decreased by 37 basis points to 31.2%\ncompared to 2021. A greater LIFO provision which was driven by higher product costs, a higher proportion of lower\nmargin consumables sales, and increases in inventory markdowns, damages and shrink each contributed to the decrease in\nthe gross profit rate. These factors were partially offset by higher inventory markups and improvements in transportation\ncosts.\nSG&A. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 24.0% in 2023 compared to 22.4% in 2022, an increase of 153\nbasis points. The primary expenses that were higher as a percentage of net sales in 2023 were retail labor, store occupancy\ncosts, depreciation and amortization, repairs and maintenance, and other services purchased, including debt and credit\ncard transaction fees, which were partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation.\nSG&A as a percentage of net sales was 22.4% in 2022 compared to 22.2% in 2021, an increase of 25 basis\npoints. The primary expenses that were higher as a percentage of net sales in 2022 were utilities, retail labor, and repairs\nand maintenance, partially offset by incentive compensation expenses and store occupancy costs.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased $115.5 million to $326.8 million in 2023 compared to 2022 and\nincreased $53.7 million to $211.3 million in 2022 compared to 2021, in each case primarily due to higher outstanding\nborrowings and higher interest rates. See the detailed discussion under \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d regarding the\nfinancing of various long-term obligations.\nIncome Taxes. The effective income tax rate for 2023 was 21.6% compared to a rate of 22.5% for 2022 which\nrepresents a net decrease of 0.9 percentage points. The effective tax rate was lower in 2023 primarily due to the effect of\ncertain rate-impacting items (such as federal tax credits) on lower earnings before taxes and a lower state effective rate\nresulting from increased recognition of state tax credits.\nThe effective income tax rate for 2022 was 22.5% compared to a rate of 21.7% for 2021 which represents a net\nincrease of 0.8 percentage points. The effective income tax rate was higher in 2022 primarily due to decreased income tax\nbenefits associated with stock-based compensation compared to 2021.\nEffects of Inflation\nIn 2023, we experienced moderate increases in product costs due to lower rates of inflation. In addition, we\ncontinued to experience elevated but relatively stable costs of building materials and certain of our other capital costs. In\n2022, we experienced higher rates of inflation affecting product costs, the costs of building materials and certain of our\nother capital costs. In 2021, we experienced increases in product costs due in part to higher rates of inflation.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3905, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ea1e1b8d-b742-415d-b99d-8e5700132000": {"__data__": {"id_": "ea1e1b8d-b742-415d-b99d-8e5700132000", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "dg_Annual Report.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\eylan\\Documents\\read_pdf\\llama_index_chatbot\\data\\dg_Annual Report.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1442786, "creation_date": "2024-12-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2f2473d7-e2af-40dc-b527-db76aaa1cfff", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "dg_Annual Report.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\eylan\\Documents\\read_pdf\\llama_index_chatbot\\data\\dg_Annual Report.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1442786, "creation_date": "2024-12-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-30"}, "hash": "952a50295caf50fbd446b076207c4bdfb06eade03d73b53dafa3949866714610", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8b975872-65b1-41b5-a3b4-49026998b676", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "56bde6edee0b40e0f9b590a53e4c6e452c147e3f8af618f52683163b89f703ec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Table of Contents\n33\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCurrent Financial Condition and Recent Developments\nDuring the past three years, we have generated an aggregate of approximately $7.2 billion in cash flows from\noperating activities and incurred approximately $4.3 billion in capital expenditures. During that period, we expanded the\nnumber of stores we operate by 2,809, representing store growth of approximately 16%, and we remodeled or relocated\n5,910 stores, or approximately 34% of the stores we operated as of the beginning of the three-year period. In 2024, we\nintend to continue our current strategy of pursuing store growth, remodels and relocations although at a slower pace than\nthe past three years.\nAt February 2, 2024, we had a $2.0 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement (the \u201cRevolving Facility\u201d),\n$6.9 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, and a commercial paper program that may provide borrowing\navailability of up to $2.0 billion. At February 2, 2024, we had total consolidated outstanding debt (including the current\nportion of long-term obligations) of $7.0 billion, most of which was in the form of senior notes. All of our material\nborrowing arrangements are described in greater detail below. Our borrowing availability under the Revolving Facility\nmay be effectively limited by our commercial paper notes (\u201cCP Notes\u201d) as further described below. The information\ncontained in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this report is incorporated\nherein by reference.\nWe believe our cash flow from operations, and our existing cash balances, combined with availability under the\nRevolving Facility, CP Notes and access to the debt markets, will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current\nobligations, projected working capital requirements, capital spending and anticipated dividend payments for a period that\nincludes the next twelve months as well as the next several years. However, our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity\nmay be affected by numerous factors, many of which are outside of our control. Depending on our liquidity levels,\nconditions in the capital markets and other factors, we may from time to time consider the issuance of debt, equity or\nother securities, the proceeds of which could provide additional liquidity for our operations.\nFor fiscal 2024, we anticipate potential combined borrowings under the Revolving Facility and CP Notes to be a\nmaximum of approximately $500 million outstanding at any one time.\nRevolving Facility\nOur Revolving Facility consists of a $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility of which up to $100.0\nmillion is available for the issuance of letters of credit and which is scheduled to mature on December 2, 2026.\nBorrowings under the Revolving Facility bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable interest rate margin plus, at\nour option, either (a) Adjusted Term SOFR (which is Term SOFR (as published by CME Group Benchmark\nAdministration Limited) plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10%) or (b) a base rate (which is usually equal to the prime\nrate). The applicable interest rate margin for borrowings as of February 2, 2024 was 1.015% for Adjusted Term SOFR\nborrowings and 0.015% for base-rate borrowings. We must also pay a facility fee, payable on any used and unused\ncommitment amounts of the Revolving Facility, and customary fees on letters of credit issued under the Revolving\nFacility. As of February 2, 2024, the facility fee rate was 0.11%. The applicable interest rate margins for borrowings, the\nfacility fees and the letter of credit fees under the Revolving Facility are subject to adjustment from time to time based on\nour long-term senior unsecured debt ratings.\nThe credit agreement governing the Revolving Facility contains a number of customary affirmative and negative\ncovenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, our (and our subsidiaries\u2019) ability to: incur\nadditional liens; sell all or substantially all of our assets; consummate certain fundamental changes or change in our lines\nof business; and incur additional subsidiary indebtedness. The credit agreement governing the Revolving Facility also\ncontains financial covenants which require the maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum\nleverage ratio.

The authorization allows repurchases from time to time in open market transactions, including pursuant\nto trading plans adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or in\nprivately negotiated transactions. The timing, manner and number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of\nfactors, including price, market conditions, compliance with the covenants and restrictions under our debt agreements,\ncash requirements, excess debt capacity, results of operations, financial condition and other factors. The repurchase\nprogram has no expiration date and may be modified or terminated from time to time at the discretion of our Board of\nDirectors. To preserve our investment grade credit rating and maintain financial flexibility, we do not plan to repurchase\nshares during fiscal 2024. For more detail about our share repurchase program, see Part II, Item 5 of this report and Note\n11 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nOther Considerations\nIn March 2024, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.59 per share which is payable on\nor before April 23, 2024 to shareholders of record of our common stock on April 9, 2024. We paid quarterly cash\ndividends of $0.59 per share in 2023. Although the Board currently expects to continue regular quarterly cash dividends,\nthe declaration and amount of future cash dividends are subject to the Board\u2019s sole discretion and will depend upon,\namong other factors, our results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions, excess debt\ncapacity and other factors that our Board may deem relevant in its sole discretion.\nOur inventory balance represented approximately 49% of our total assets exclusive of operating lease assets,\ngoodwill, and other intangible assets as of February 2, 2024.

An actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method is made at the end of each year based on the\ninventory levels and costs at that time. In contrast, interim LIFO calculations are based on management\u2019s annual estimates\nof sales, the rate of inflation or deflation, and year-end inventory levels. We also perform analyses for determining\nobsolete inventory, adjusting inventory on a quarterly basis to an LCM value based on various management assumptions\nincluding estimated below cost markdowns not yet recorded, but required to liquidate such inventory in future periods.\nFactors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and anticipated demand based on changes\nin competitors\u2019 practices, consumer preferences, consumer spending, significant weather events and unseasonable weather\npatterns. Certain of these factors are outside of our control and may result in greater than estimated markdowns to entice\nconsumer purchases of excess inventory. The amount and timing of markdowns may vary significantly from year to year.\nWe perform physical inventories in a significant majority of our stores on an annual basis. We calculate our\nshrink provision based on actual physical inventory results during the fiscal period and an accrual for estimated shrink\noccurring subsequent to a physical inventory through the end of the fiscal reporting period. This accrual is calculated as a\npercentage of sales at each retail store, at a department level, based on the store\u2019s most recent historical shrink rate. From\ntime to time as circumstances may warrant, we consider more recent shrink experience in the calculation of our shrink\naccrual. The impact of doing so has not been material. To the extent that subsequent physical inventories yield different\nresults than the estimated accrual, our effective shrink rate for a given reporting period will include the impact of\nadjusting to the actual results.\nWe believe our estimates and assumptions related to the application of the RIM results in a merchandise\ninventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost on a consistent basis.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets. Impairment of long-lived assets results when the carrying value of the assets\nexceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated by the assets. Our estimate of undiscounted future store\ncash flows is based upon historical operations of the stores and estimates of future profitability which encompasses many\nfactors that are subject to variability and are difficult to predict. If our estimates of future cash flows are not materially\naccurate, our impairment analysis could be impacted accordingly. If a long-lived asset is found to be impaired, the amount\nrecognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset\u2019s estimated fair value. The\nfair value is estimated based primarily upon projected future cash flows (discounted at our credit adjusted risk-free rate)\nor other reasonable estimates of fair market value. Although not currently anticipated, changes in these estimates,\nassumptions or projections could materially affect the determination of fair value or impairment.\nInsurance Liabilities. We retain a significant portion of the risk for our workers\u2019 compensation, employee health,\ngeneral liability, property loss, auto liability and certain third-party landlord claim exposures. These represent significant\ncosts primarily due to our large employee base and number of stores. Provisions are made for these liabilities on an\nundiscounted basis. Certain of these liabilities are based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported\nclaims developed using actuarial methodologies based on historical claim trends, which have been and are anticipated to\ncontinue to be materially accurate. If future claim trends deviate from recent historical patterns, or other unanticipated\nevents affect the number and significance of future claims, we may be required to record additional expenses or expense\nreductions, which could be material to our future financial results.\nContingent Liabilities \u2013 Income Taxes. Income tax reserves are determined using the methodology established by\naccounting standards relating to uncertainty in income taxes. These standards require companies to assess each income\ntax position taken using a two-step process.

If our determinations and estimates\nprove to be inaccurate, the resulting adjustments could be material to our future financial results.\nLease Accounting. Lease liabilities are recorded at a discount based upon our estimated collateralized\nincremental borrowing rate which involves significant judgments and estimates. Factors incorporated into the calculation\nof lease discount rates include the valuations and yields of our senior notes, their credit spread over comparable U.S.\nTreasury rates, and an index of the credit spreads for all North American investment grade companies by rating. To\ndetermine an indicative secured rate, we use the estimated credit spread improvement that would result from an upgrade\nof one ratings classification by tenor. Many of our stores are subject to build-to-suit arrangements with landlords, which\ntypically carry a primary lease term of up to 15 years with multiple renewal options. We also have stores subject to\nshorter-term leases and many of these leases have renewal options. We record single lease expense on a straight-line basis\nover the lease term including any option periods that are reasonably certain to be renewed, commencing on the date that\nwe take physical possession of the property from the landlord. Tenant allowances, to the extent received, are recorded as a\nreduction of the right of use asset. Improvements of leased properties are amortized over the shorter of the life of the\napplicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.\nShare-Based Payments. Our stock option awards are valued on an individual grant basis using the Black-\nScholes-Merton closed form option pricing model. We believe that this model fairly estimates the value of our stock\noption awards. The application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental in the valuation of stock\noptions, which affects compensation expense related to these options. These assumptions include the term that the options\nare expected to be outstanding, the historical volatility of our stock price, applicable interest rates and the dividend yield\nof our stock. Other factors involving judgments that affect the expensing of share-based payments include estimated\nforfeiture rates of share-based awards.

To\nminimize this risk, we may periodically use financial instruments, including derivatives. All derivative financial\ninstrument transactions must be authorized and executed pursuant to approval by the Board of Directors. As a matter of\npolicy, we do not buy or sell financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes, and any such derivative financial\ninstruments are intended to be used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure. Our objective is to\ncorrelate derivative financial instruments and the underlying exposure being hedged, so that fluctuations in the value of\nthe financial instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying economic exposure.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our short-term borrowings and long-term debt.  We \nmanage our interest rate risk through the strategic use of fixed and variable interest rate debt and, from time to time, \nderivative financial instruments. Currently, we are counterparty to certain interest rate swaps with a total notional amount \nof $350.0 million entered into in May 2021. These swaps are scheduled to mature in April 2030. Under the terms of these \nagreements, we swap fixed interest rates on a portion of our 2030 Senior Notes for compounded SOFR rates. In recent \nyears, our principal interest rate exposure has been from outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Facility as well as \nour commercial paper program. As of February 2, 2024, we had no consolidated commercial paper borrowings and no \nborrowings outstanding under our Revolving Facility. For a detailed discussion of our Revolving Facility and our \ncommercial paper program, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.\nA change in interest rates on variable rate debt impacts our pre-tax earnings and cash flows; whereas a change in\ninterest rates on fixed rate debt impacts the economic fair value of debt but not our pre-tax earnings and cash flows.\nAt February 2, 2024, our primary interest rate exposure was from changes in interest rates which affect our\nvariable rate debt. Based on our outstanding variable rate debt as of February 2, 2024, after giving consideration to our\ninterest rate swap agreements, the annualized effect of a one percentage point increase in variable interest rates would\nhave resulted in a pretax reduction of our earnings and cash flows of approximately $3.5 million in 2023.\nAt February 3, 2023, our primary interest rate exposure was from changes in interest rates which affect our\nvariable rate debt. Based on our outstanding variable rate debt as of February 3, 2023, after giving consideration to our\ninterest rate swap agreements, the annualized effect of a one percentage point increase in variable interest rates would\nhave resulted in a pretax reduction of our earnings and cash flows of approximately $18.5 million in 2022.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3122, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8cd0fe18-96ad-4c17-b3c9-c113627b8e8b": {"__data__": {"id_": "8cd0fe18-96ad-4c17-b3c9-c113627b8e8b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "42", "file_name": "dg_Annual Report.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\eylan\\Documents\\read_pdf\\llama_index_chatbot\\data\\dg_Annual Report.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1442786, "creation_date": "2024-12-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "999687e1-4780-4eff-abd4-e05fc15759a6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "42", "file_name": "dg_Annual Report.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\eylan\\Documents\\read_pdf\\llama_index_chatbot\\data\\dg_Annual Report.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1442786, "creation_date": "2024-12-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-30"}, "hash": "f04569ae2ca6f741148dfd222db58e973d87896f2e36d4064bee3de7198cfdd2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Table of Contents\n42\nITEM 8.

Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement,\nwhether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of\nthe financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial\nstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

At February\n2, 2024, the Company\u2019s reserves for self-insurance risks were $307.9 million, which\nincludes workers\u2019 compensation and general liability reserves. As discussed in Note\n1 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company retains a significant portion\nof risk related to its workers\u2019 compensation and general liability exposures.\nAccordingly, provisions are recorded for the Company\u2019s estimates of such losses.\nThe undiscounted future claim costs for the workers\u2019 compensation and general\nliability exposures are estimated using actuarial methods.\nAuditing management\u2019s assessment of the recorded workers\u2019 compensation and\ngeneral liability self-insurance exposure reserves was complex and judgmental due\nto the significant assumptions required in projecting the exposure on incurred\nclaims (including those which have not been reported to the Company). In\nparticular, the estimate was sensitive to significant assumptions such as loss\ndevelopment factors, trend factors, and pure loss rates.\nHow We Addressed the\nMatter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating\neffectiveness of controls over the Company\u2019s accounting for these self-insurance\nexposures. For example, we tested controls over the appropriateness of the\nassumptions management used in the calculation and the completeness and accuracy\nof the data underlying the reserves.\nTo test the Company\u2019s determination of the estimated required workers\u2019\ncompensation and general liability self-insurance reserves, we performed audit\nprocedures that included, among others, assessing the actuarial valuation\nmethodologies utilized by management, testing the significant assumptions\ndiscussed above, testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used\nby the Company in its evaluation, and testing the mathematical accuracy of the\ncalculations. We also compared the significant assumptions used by management to\nindustry accepted actuarial assumptions, reassessed the accuracy of management\u2019s\nhistorical estimates utilized in prior period evaluations, and utilized an actuarial\nvaluation specialist to assist in assessing the valuation methodologies and\nsignificant assumptions used in the valuation analysis, as well as to compare the\nCompany\u2019s recorded reserve to an independently developed range of actuarial\nreserves.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2001.\nNashville,

"Table of Contents\n49\nDOLLAR GENERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. Basis of presentation and accounting policies\nBasis of presentation\nThese notes contain references to the years 2023, 2022, and 2021, which represent fiscal years ended February 2,\n2024, February 3, 2023, and January 28, 2022, respectively. The Company\u2019s 2023 and 2021 accounting periods were each\ncomprised of 52 weeks, and the 2022 accounting period was comprised of 53 weeks. The Company\u2019s fiscal year ends on\nthe Friday closest to January 31. The consolidated financial statements include all subsidiaries of the Company, except for\nits not-for-profit subsidiary which the Company does not control. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated.\nThe Company sells general merchandise on a retail basis through 19,986 stores (as of February 2, 2024) in 48\nU.S. states and Mexico with the greatest concentration of stores in the southern, southwestern, midwestern and eastern\nUnited States. As of February 2, 2024, the Company operated 18 distribution centers for non-refrigerated products, ten\ncold storage distribution centers, and three combination distribution centers which have both refrigerated and non-\nrefrigerated products. The Company leases 14 of these facilities and the remainder are owned.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and original\nmaturities of three months or less when purchased. Such investments primarily consist of money market funds, bank\ndeposits, certificates of deposit, and commercial paper. The carrying amounts of these items are a reasonable estimate of\ntheir fair value due to the short maturity of these investments.\nPayments due from processors for electronic tender transactions classified as cash and cash equivalents totaled\napproximately $109.3 million and $157.3 million at February 2, 2024 and February 3, 2023, respectively.\nInvestments in debt and equity securities\nThe Company accounts for investments in debt and marketable equity securities as held-to-maturity, available-\nfor-sale, or trading, depending on their classification. Debt securities categorized as held-to-maturity are stated at\namortized cost. Debt and equity securities categorized as available-for-sale are stated at fair value, with any unrealized\ngains and losses, net of deferred income taxes, reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nTrading securities are stated at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded as a component of Selling, general and\nadministrative (\u201cSG&A\u201d) expense. The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method.\nMerchandise inventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market (\u201cLCM\u201d) with cost determined using the retail last-in, first-\nout (\u201cLIFO\u201d) method as this method results in a better matching of costs and revenues. Under the Company\u2019s retail\ninventory method (\u201cRIM\u201d), the calculation of gross profit and the resulting valuation of inventories at cost are computed\nby applying a calculated cost-to-retail inventory ratio to the retail value of sales at a department level. The use of the RIM\nwill result in valuing inventories at LCM if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of\ninventories. Costs directly associated with warehousing and distribution are capitalized into inventory.\nThe excess of current cost over LIFO cost was approximately $875.1 million and $813.6 million at February 2,\n2024 and February 3, 2023, respectively.

The Company\u2019s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows is based upon historical operations of\nthe stores and estimates of future store profitability which encompasses many factors that are subject to variability and\ndifficult to predict. If a long-lived asset is found to be impaired, the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the\ndifference between the carrying value and the asset\u2019s estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated based primarily\nupon estimated future cash flows over the asset\u2019s remaining useful life (discounted at the Company\u2019s credit adjusted risk-\nfree rate) or other reasonable estimates of fair market value. Assets to be disposed of are adjusted to the fair value less the\ncost to sell if less than the book value.\nThe Company recorded impairment charges included in SG&A expense of approximately $6.7 million in 2023,\n$2.1 million in 2022 and $2.6 million in 2021, to reduce the carrying value of certain of its stores\u2019 assets. Such action was\ndeemed necessary based on the Company\u2019s evaluation that such amounts would not be recoverable primarily due to\ninsufficient sales or excessive costs resulting in the carrying value of the assets exceeding the estimated undiscounted\nfuture cash flows generated by the assets at these locations.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets\nIf not deemed indefinite, the Company amortizes intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. Goodwill\nand intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of\nimpairment are present. Definite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment if indicators of impairment are present.\nImpaired assets are written down to fair value as required. No impairment of intangible assets has been identified during\nany of the periods presented.\nIn accordance with accounting standards for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, an entity has the\noption first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than\nnot that goodwill or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If after such assessment an entity concludes that the\nasset is not impaired, then the entity is not required to take further action. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then\nit is required to determine the fair value of the asset using a quantitative impairment test. If the results of such test indicate\nimpairment, the associated assets must be written down to fair value as described in further detail below.\nThe quantitative goodwill impairment test requires management to make judgments in determining what\nassumptions to use in the calculation. The process consists of comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying\namount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, management would\nthen determine if the difference between the carrying amount and fair value is greater than the carrying amount of\ngoodwill allocated to the reporting unit. If it is, the impairment recognized would be equal to the total carrying amount of\ngoodwill allocated to the reporting unit, and if not, impairment would be recognized equal to the difference between the\ncarrying amount of the reporting unit and its fair value.\nThe quantitative impairment test for intangible assets compares the fair value of the intangible asset with its\ncarrying amount. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in\nan amount equal to that excess.\nThe Company\u2019s goodwill balance has an indefinite life and is not expected to be deductible for income tax\npurposes.

Fair value is a market-based\nmeasurement, not an entity-specific measurement. Therefore, a fair value measurement should be determined based on\nthe assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. As a basis for considering market\nparticipant assumptions in fair value measurements, fair value accounting standards establish a fair value hierarchy that\ndistinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the\nreporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity\u2019s\nown assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy).\nLevel 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the\nCompany has the ability to access. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are directly\nor indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities\nin active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest\nrates, foreign exchange rates, and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 3 inputs are\nunobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are based on an entity\u2019s own assumptions, as there is little, if any,\nobservable market activity. In instances where the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the\nfair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on\nthe lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company\u2019s assessment of the\nsignificance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors\nspecific to the asset or liability.\nOther comprehensive income\nThe Company previously recorded a loss on the settlement of derivatives associated with the issuance of long-\nterm debt in 2013 which was deferred to other comprehensive income and is being amortized as an increase to interest\nexpense over the 10-year period of the debt\u2019s maturity.\nForeign currency denominated assets and liabilities held by foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars\nusing the spot rate in effect at the consolidated balance sheet date. Results of operations are translated using the average\nexchange rates in the period in which they occur. The effect of exchange rate fluctuations on translation of assets and\nliabilities is included as a component of shareholders\u2019 equity in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss.\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company recognizes retail sales in its stores at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise.

Estimated breakage revenue, a percentage of gift cards that will never be\nredeemed based on historical redemption rates, is recognized over time in proportion to actual gift card redemptions. The\nCompany recorded breakage revenue of $2.6 million, $2.3 million and $1.7 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nAdvertising costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed upon performance, \u201cfirst showing\u201d or distribution, and are reflected in SG&A\nexpenses net of earned cooperative advertising amounts provided by vendors which are specific, incremental and\notherwise qualifying expenses related to the promotion or sale of vendor products for dollar amounts up to but not\nexceeding actual incremental costs.

Forfeitures are estimated at the time of valuation and reduce expense ratably over the vesting\nperiod. This estimate may be adjusted periodically based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to\ndiffer, from the prior estimate. The forfeiture rate is the estimated percentage of share-based awards granted that are\nexpected to be forfeited or canceled before becoming fully vested. The Company bases this estimate on historical\nexperience or estimates of future trends, as applicable. An increase in the forfeiture rate will decrease compensation\nexpense.\nThe fair value of each option grant is separately estimated and amortized into compensation expense on a\nstraight-line basis between the applicable grant date and each vesting date. The Company has estimated the fair value of\nall stock option awards as of the grant date by applying the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing valuation model. The\napplication of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive to variation in the\ndetermination of compensation expense.\nThe Company calculates compensation expense for restricted stock, share units and similar awards as the\ndifference between the market price of the underlying stock or similar award on the grant date and the purchase price, if\nany. Such expense is recognized on a straight-line basis for time-based awards and on an accelerated or straight-line basis\nfor performance awards depending on the period over which the recipient earns the awards.\nStore pre-opening costs\nPre-opening costs related to new store openings and the related construction periods are expensed as incurred.\nIncome taxes\nUnder the accounting standards for income taxes, the asset and liability method is used for computing the future\nincome tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements or\nincome tax returns. Deferred income tax expense or benefit is the net change during the year in the Company\u2019s deferred\nincome tax assets and liabilities.\nThe Company includes income tax related interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income tax\nexpense.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3837, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f336a329-b5fb-4c08-92ce-7e32e9beeb4e": {"__data__": {"id_": "f336a329-b5fb-4c08-92ce-7e32e9beeb4e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "dg_Annual Report.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\eylan\\Documents\\read_pdf\\llama_index_chatbot\\data\\dg_Annual Report.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1442786, "creation_date": "2024-12-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "68338efe-0082-42de-afaa-b739f27bf478", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "dg_Annual Report.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\eylan\\Documents\\read_pdf\\llama_index_chatbot\\data\\dg_Annual Report.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1442786, "creation_date": "2024-12-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-30"}, "hash": "8c9445cbec495f7be7dc3e3fe5aabefca47765d183bc0b3bd59eca915f3c0c16", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Table of Contents\n55\nIncome tax reserves are determined using a methodology which requires companies to assess each income tax\nposition taken using a two-step process. A determination is first made as to whether it is more likely than not that the\nposition will be sustained, based upon the technical merits, upon examination by the taxing authorities. If the tax position\nis expected to meet the more likely than not criteria, the benefit recorded for the tax position equals the largest amount\nthat is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the respective tax position. Uncertain tax\npositions require determinations and estimated liabilities to be made based on provisions of the tax law which may be\nsubject to change or varying interpretation. If the Company\u2019s determinations and estimates prove to be inaccurate, the\nresulting adjustments could be material to the Company\u2019s future financial results.\nManagement estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ\nfrom those estimates.\nAccounting standards\nIn March 2020 and January 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued accounting\nstandards updates pertaining to reference rate reform. This collective guidance is in response to accounting concerns\nregarding contract modifications and hedge accounting because of impending rate reform associated with structural risks\nof interbank offered rates (IBORs), and, particularly, the risk of cessation of LIBOR, related to regulators in several\njurisdictions around the world having undertaken reference rate reform initiatives to identify alternative reference rates.\nThe guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships,\nand other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The adoption of this guidance is\neffective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2024. The Company completed its transition from\nLIBOR to Term SOFR in its credit agreements governing the Facilities in fiscal year 2022 with no material impact to the\nfinancial statements.\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued new required disclosures for supplier finance programs. These disclosures\nare intended to enhance the transparency about the use of supplier finance programs for investors. The amendments are\neffective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with the\nexception of the disclosure of rollforward information, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,\n2023. The Company adopted the required disclosures for this accounting standard update in fiscal 2023, except for the\ndisclosure of rollforward activity, which will be adopted for fiscal year 2024.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued an update to the required disclosures for segment reporting.  The update is \nintended to improve reportable segment disclosures, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment \nexpenses.  The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal \nyears beginning after December 15, 2024.  The Company does not expect the adoption of this update to have a material \nimpact on its consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued an update to the required disclosures for income taxes. The update is\nintended to improve the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disclosures to enhance the transparency and decision\nusefulness of income tax disclosures.

Benefit plans\nThe Dollar General Corporation 401(k) Savings and Retirement Plan, which became effective on January 1,1998, is a safe harbor defined contribution plan and is subject to the Employee Retirement and Income Security Act(\u201cERISA\u201d).\nA participant\u2019s right to claim a distribution of his or her account balance is dependent on the plan, ERISAguidelines and Internal Revenue Service regulations. All active participants are fully vested in all contributions to the401(k) plan. During 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company expensed approximately $35.9 million, $35.7 million and$34.0 million, respectively, for matching contributions.\nThe Company also has a compensation deferral plan (\u201cCDP\u201d) and a nonqualified supplemental retirement plan(\u201cSERP\u201d), known as the Dollar General Corporation CDP/SERP Plan, for a select group of management and other keyemployees. The Company incurred compensation expense for these plans of approximately $1.0 million in 2023, $1.2million in 2022 and $1.3 million in 2021.\nThe deferred compensation liability associated with the CDP/SERP Plan is reflected in the consolidated balancesheets as further disclosed in Note 6.\n9. Share-based payments\nThe Company accounts for share-based payments in accordance with applicable accounting standards, underwhich the fair value of each award is separately estimated and amortized into compensation expense over the serviceperiod. The fair value of the Company\u2019s stock option grants are estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. The application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and highlysensitive in the determination of compensation expense. The fair value of the Company\u2019s other share-based awardsdiscussed below are estimated using the Company\u2019s closing stock price on the grant date. Forfeitures are estimated at thetime of valuation and reduce expense ratably over the vesting period.\nOn May 26, 2021, the Company\u2019s shareholders approved the Dollar General Corporation 2021 Stock IncentivePlan (\u201c2021 Plan\u201d), which replaced the Company\u2019s 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (\u201c2007 Plan\u201d). The Plans allow thegranting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, and other stock-based awards or dividend equivalent rights to keyemployees, directors, consultants or other persons having a service relationship with the Company, its subsidiaries andcertain of its affiliates. Upon the effective date of the 2021 Plan, no new awards may be granted under the 2007 Plan.Awards previously granted under the 2007 Plan remain outstanding in accordance with their terms. The number of sharesof Company common stock authorized for grant under the 2021 Plan is 11,838,143.\nGenerally, share-based awards issued by the Company are in the form of stock options, restricted stock units andperformance share units, and unless noted otherwise, the disclosures that follow refer to such awards. With limitedexceptions, stock options and restricted stock units granted to employees generally vest ratably on an annual basis overfour-year and three-year periods, respectively.

In allocating the Performance ShareUnits between [the One-Year Goal and the Three-Year Goal], any remaining fractional Share underlying the targetnumber of Performance Share Units shall be allocated to [the One-Year Goal]. If the performance level for aperformance goal measure is below the established [threshold] for the [Adjusted ROIC PSUs] or is below theestablished [target] for the [Adjusted EBITDA PSUs], [no] Performance Share Units shall be earned for theapplicable Performance Period with respect to such performance goal measure. If the performance level for aperformance goal measure is above the established maximum, no additional Performance Share Units shall beearned above the associated maximum payout level for the applicable Performance Period with respect to suchperformance goal measure. Within [sixty (60)] days following the end of the applicable Performance Period, theCommittee will determine the extent to which the applicable performance goal measure has been met and thenumber of Performance Share Units earned (subject to the additional service and payment requirements inSections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3).

This Policy is\ndesigned to comply with, and shall be interpreted to be consistent with, Section 954 of the Dodd-FrankWall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, as codified by Section 10D of the SecuritiesExchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), Exchange Act Rule 10D-1 promulgatedthereunder (or any successor provision), and the rules and requirements of the New York Stock Exchange\n(the \u201cExchange\u201d) (including Section 303A.14 of the Exchange Listed Company Manual or any successorprovision). This Policy replaces the Company\u2019s Clawback Policy adopted on November 30, 2016.\n1.   Recovery of Excess Incentive Compensation.  If the Company is required to prepare aRestatement, the Board shall, unless the Board\u2019s Compensation and Human Capital Management\nCommittee (the \u201cCompensation Committee\u201d) determines it to be Impracticable, take reasonably promptaction to recover all Recoverable Compensation from any Covered Person. The Company\u2019s obligation to recover Recoverable Compensation is not dependent on if or when the restated financial statements are filed with the SEC.  Subject to applicable law, the Board may seek to recover Recoverable Compensation\nby requiring a Covered Person to repay such amount to the Company; by adding \u201choldback\u201d or deferralpolicies to incentive compensation; by adding post-vesting \u201cholding\u201d or \u201cno transfer\u201d policies to equityawards; by set-off of a Covered Person\u2019s other compensation; by reducing future compensation; or bysuch other means or combination of means as the Board, in its sole discretion, determines to be\nappropriate. This Policy is in addition to (and not in lieu of) any right of repayment, forfeiture or right ofoff-set against any Covered Person that may be available under applicable law or otherwise (whetherimplemented prior to or after adoption of this Policy).  The Board may, in its sole discretion and in theexercise of its business judgment, determine whether and to what extent additional action is appropriate to\naddress the circumstances surrounding any Restatement to minimize the likelihood of any recurrence andto impose such other discipline as it deems appropriate.\n2.   Administration of Policy.  The Board shall have full authority to administer, amend orterminate this Policy, subject to compliance with any applicable Exchange listing standards and laws,\nrules and regulations. The Board shall, subject to the provisions of this Policy, make such determinationsand interpretations and take such actions in connection with this Policy as it deems necessary, appropriateor advisable.

Basis of presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Dollar General Corporation (which\nindividually or together with its subsidiaries, as the context requires, is referred to as the \u201cCompany\u201d) have been prepared in\naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) for interim\nfinancial information and are presented in accordance with the requirements of Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.\nSuch financial statements consequently do not include all of the disclosures normally required by U.S. GAAP for annual\nfinancial statements or those normally made in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the condensed\nconsolidated balance sheet as of February 2, 2024, which was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at\nthat date. Accordingly, readers of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should refer to the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2024 for additional information.\nThe Company\u2019s fiscal year ends on the Friday closest to January 31. Unless the context requires otherwise, references\nto years contained herein pertain to the Company\u2019s fiscal year. The Company\u2019s 2024 fiscal year is scheduled to be a 52-week\naccounting period ending on January 31, 2025, and the 2023 fiscal year was a 52-week accounting period that ended on\nFebruary 2, 2024.\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the\nCompany\u2019s customary accounting practices. In management\u2019s opinion, all adjustments (which are of a normal recurring\nnature) necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated financial position as of August 2, 2024, and results of operations\nfor the 13-week and 26-week accounting periods ended August 2, 2024 and August 4, 2023, have been made.\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management\nto make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets\nand liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and\nexpenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Because the Company\u2019s business is\nmoderately seasonal, the results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire\nyear.\nThe Company uses the last-in, first-out (\u201cLIFO\u201d) method of valuing inventory. An actual valuation of inventory\nunder the LIFO method is made at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. Accordingly,\ninterim LIFO calculations are based on management\u2019s estimates of expected year-end inventory levels, sales for the year and\nthe expected rate of inflation or deflation for the year. The interim LIFO calculations are subject to adjustment in the final\nyear-end LIFO inventory valuation. The Company recorded a LIFO provision of $10.5 million and $20.2 million in the\nrespective 13-week periods, and $20.8 million and $48.4 million in the respective 26-week periods, ended August 2, 2024 and\nAugust 4, 2023. In addition, ongoing estimates of inventory shrinkage and initial markups and markdowns are included in the\ninterim cost of goods sold calculation.\nWe utilize supply chain finance programs whereby qualifying suppliers may elect at their sole discretion to sell our\npayment obligations to designated third party financial institutions. As of August 2, 2024 and February 2, 2024, the amount of\nobligations outstanding that the Company has confirmed with the financial institutions under the supply chain finance\nprogram were $293.5 million and $306.8 million, respectively.\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued an update to the required disclosures\nfor income taxes. The update is intended to improve the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disclosures to enhance the\ntransparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2024. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this required disclosure.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4400, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8870d2c7-c0dd-4a81-9f4b-ab74ee987517": {"__data__": {"id_": "8870d2c7-c0dd-4a81-9f4b-ab74ee987517", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "DG_Quarterly Report.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\eylan\\Documents\\read_pdf\\llama_index_chatbot\\data\\DG_Quarterly Report.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 384966, "creation_date": "2024-12-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8893108d-9362-4f99-8016-bd8a9417392f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "DG_Quarterly Report.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\eylan\\Documents\\read_pdf\\llama_index_chatbot\\data\\DG_Quarterly Report.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 384966, "creation_date": "2024-12-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-30"}, "hash": "0230eb341af5eb75852496c6006a75efb15233af35fe5b8a66012f24e8f5adc8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "8\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued an update to the required disclosures for segment reporting.  The update is \nintended to improve reportable segment disclosures, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment \nexpenses.  The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years \nbeginning after December 15, 2024.  The Company does not expect the adoption of this update to have a material impact on \nits consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued new required disclosures for supplier finance programs. These disclosures are\nintended to enhance the transparency about the use of supplier finance programs for investors. The amendments are effective\nfor fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with the exception of\nthe disclosure of rollforward information, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023.

Income taxes  \nUnder the accounting standards for income taxes, the asset and liability method is used for computing the future\nincome tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements or income\ntax returns.\nIncome tax reserves are determined using the methodology established by accounting standards for income taxes\nwhich require companies to assess each income tax position taken using the following two-step approach. A determination is\nfirst made as to whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained, based upon the technical merits, upon\nexamination by the taxing authorities.

The IRS, at its discretion, may choose to examine the Company\u2019s 2020 through 2022 fiscal year income tax filings.\nThe Company has various state income tax examinations that are currently in progress. Generally, with few exceptions, the\nCompany\u2019s 2020 and later tax years remain open for examination by the various state taxing authorities.\nAs of August 2, 2024, the total reserves for uncertain tax benefits, interest expense related to income taxes and\npotential income tax penalties were $11.2 million, $1.6 million and $0.8 million, respectively, for a total of $13.6 million. The\nuncertain tax liability is reflected in noncurrent other liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheet.\nThe Company\u2019s reserve for uncertain tax positions is expected to be reduced by $2.1 million in the coming twelve\nmonths resulting from expiring statutes of limitations or settlements. As of August 2, 2024, approximately $11.2 million of the\nreserve for uncertain tax positions would impact the Company\u2019s effective income tax rate if the Company were to recognize\nthe tax benefit for these positions.\nThe effective income tax rate for the 13-week and 26-week periods ended August 2, 2024 was 22.3% and 22.8%\nrespectively, compared to a rate of 22.9% and 22.3% for the 13-week and 26-week periods ended August 4, 2023. The\neffective income tax rate was lower for the 13-week period in 2024 than the comparable 13-week period in 2023 primarily due \nto the effect of certain rate-impacting items, such as federal tax credits, on lower earnings before taxes.  The effective income \ntax rate was higher for the 26-week period in 2024 than the comparable 26-week period in 2023 primarily due to an increase \nin the state effective tax rate and expense from stock-based compensation offset by the effect of certain rate-impacting items, \nsuch as federal tax credits, on lower earnings before taxes in the 26-week period in 2024.\nThe Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development has proposed a global minimum tax of 15% on a \ncountry-by-country basis (\u201cPillar Two\u201d). Pursuant to Pillar Two, countries have enacted minimum tax rates of 15% effective \nfor the 2024 tax year while other countries have enacted or proposed legislation making the 15% minimum tax rate effective \nfor the 2025 tax year or later. The Company operates in a country that is currently assessing the enactment of the 15% \nminimum tax rate beginning in 2025. If enacted, the Company does not believe it will have a material impact on tax expense.  \n4. Leases\nAs of August 2, 2024, the Company\u2019s primary leasing activities were real estate leases for most of its retail store\nlocations and certain of its distribution facilities.

At August 2, 2024, the weighted-average remaining lease term for\nthe Company\u2019s operating leases was 9.4 years, and the weighted average discount rate for such leases was 4.3%. Operating\nlease costs are reflected as selling, general and administrative costs in the condensed consolidated statements of income. For\nthe 26-week periods ended August 2, 2024 and August 4, 2023, such costs were $929.2 million and $855.3 million,\nrespectively. Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities of $938.9 million and $861.5\nmillion, respectively, were reflected in cash flows from operating activities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash\nflows for the 26-week periods ended August 2, 2024 and August 4, 2023.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3945, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dd355d57-4c5d-4b21-abf1-bc7bd7c24f90": {"__data__": {"id_": "dd355d57-4c5d-4b21-abf1-bc7bd7c24f90", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "DG_Quarterly Report.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\eylan\\Documents\\read_pdf\\llama_index_chatbot\\data\\DG_Quarterly Report.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 384966, "creation_date": "2024-12-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3960e4a-9ea9-49f8-af94-008e5e1ddd74", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "DG_Quarterly Report.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\eylan\\Documents\\read_pdf\\llama_index_chatbot\\data\\DG_Quarterly Report.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 384966, "creation_date": "2024-12-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-30"}, "hash": "396249a3d18f1b9ac04eedc6f99e67cd61f1081cc4d6041bb18df95e28d543f9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "df8489ad-03ac-4321-8a63-13027a4fd14c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "83192d853df13ab54bb788f32f07a22b164bcf6c826e63637f13497f8c69ec14", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "10\n5.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS\nOF OPERATIONS.\nGeneral\nThis discussion and analysis is based on, should be read with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the accompanying\nunaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes, as well as our consolidated financial statements and\nthe related Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations as contained in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2024. It also should be read in conjunction with the\ndisclosure under \u201cCautionary Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this report.\nExecutive Overview\nWe are the largest discount retailer in the United States by number of stores, with 20,345 stores located in 48 U.S.\nstates and Mexico as of August 2, 2024, with the greatest concentration of stores in the southern, southwestern, midwestern\nand eastern United States. Our first stores in Mexico opened in 2023. We offer a broad selection of merchandise, including\nconsumable products such as food, paper and cleaning products, health and beauty products and pet supplies, and non-\nconsumable products such as seasonal merchandise, home decor and domestics, and basic apparel. Our merchandise includes\nnational brands from leading manufacturers, as well as our own private brand selections with prices often at substantial\ndiscounts to national brands. We offer our customers these national brand and private brand products at everyday low prices\n(typically $10 or less) in our convenient small-box locations.\nWe believe our convenient store formats, locations, and broad selection of high-quality products at compelling values\nhave driven our substantial growth and financial success over the years and through a variety of economic cycles. We are\nmindful that the majority of our customers are value-conscious, and many have low and/or fixed incomes. As a result, we are\nintensely focused on helping our customers make the most of their spending dollars. The primary macroeconomic factors that\naffect our core customers include unemployment and underemployment rates, inflation, wage growth, changes in U.S. and\nglobal trade policy, and changes in U.S. government policy and assistance programs (including cost of living adjustments),\nsuch as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (\u201cSNAP\u201d), unemployment benefits, and economic stimulus programs.\nIn addition, the Department of Education\u2019s COVID-19 pandemic student loan forbearance program ended in September 2023,\nand payment obligations generally resumed in October 2023. The impact of this program\u2019s conclusion on our customer and\nour business has not been material, although we can make no assurance that it will not be material in the future. Finally,\nsignificant unseasonable or unusual weather patterns or extreme weather can impact customer shopping behaviors, although\nwe did not identify any such impact to any significant degree in the second quarter of 2024.\nOur core customers are often among the first to be affected by negative or uncertain economic conditions and among\nthe last to feel the effects of improving economic conditions, particularly when trends are inconsistent and of an uncertain\nduration. Our customers continue to feel constrained in the current macroeconomic environment and continue to experience\nelevated expenses that generally comprise a large portion of their household budgets, such as rent, healthcare, energy and fuel\nprices, as well as cost inflation in frequently purchased household products (including food). Furthermore, certain of our\ncustomers have reported that they are relying on credit cards to purchase basic household items. Accordingly, we expect our\ncustomers\u2019 spending to continue to be pressured overall and particularly in our non-consumables categories. As a result of this\npressure, we anticipate a heavier promotional environment in the second half of 2024, which could have an impact on our\nsales and margin results.\nWe remain committed to our long-term operating priorities as we consistently strive to improve our performance\nwhile retaining our customer-centric focus. These priorities include: 1) driving profitable sales growth, 2) capturing growth\nopportunities, 3) enhancing our position as a low-cost operator, and 4) investing in our diverse teams through development,\nempowerment and inclusion.\nWe seek to drive profitable sales growth through initiatives aimed at increasing customer traffic and average\ntransaction amount. Historically, sales in our consumables category, which tend to have lower gross margins, have been the\nkey drivers of net sales and customer traffic, while sales in our non-consumables categories, which tend to have higher gross\nmargins, have been the key drivers of more profitable sales growth and average transaction amount. Our sales mix has\ncontinued to shift toward consumables, which currently constitutes a historically high proportion of our", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5006, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "129dec94-ddd9-4857-8231-bf5dcd969f55": {"__data__": {"id_": "129dec94-ddd9-4857-8231-bf5dcd969f55", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "DG_Quarterly Report.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\eylan\\Documents\\read_pdf\\llama_index_chatbot\\data\\DG_Quarterly Report.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 384966, "creation_date": "2024-12-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f933a8cf-9380-413e-a403-e52dfc8ab5ff", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "DG_Quarterly Report.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\eylan\\Documents\\read_pdf\\llama_index_chatbot\\data\\DG_Quarterly Report.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 384966, "creation_date": "2024-12-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-30"}, "hash": "f9437b1f3d527f25c2311ccbc73cff747305a08782122e4d85cc0a355d427ebe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e0acc2ef-7e7a-4254-8a7b-ac3d1c8c68b0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9220df3a60abca9ba516c8aa252d525ac38b372e44f7782704755b9e6756c650", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "17\nsales mix. Certain of our initiatives are intended to address this sales mix trend; however, there can be no assurances that these\nefforts will be successful.\nAs we work to provide everyday low prices and meet our customers\u2019 affordability needs, we remain focused on\nenhancing our margins through inventory shrink and damage reduction initiatives, as well as pricing and markdown\noptimization, effective category management and inventory reduction efforts, distribution and transportation efficiencies,\nprivate brands penetration and global sourcing. Several of our strategic and other sales-driving initiatives are also designed to\ncapture growth opportunities and are discussed in more detail below.\nWe continue to experience significant levels of inventory shrink. Although we continue to take actions designed to\nreduce shrink, including refinement of our self-checkout strategy, and believe these actions are starting to positively impact\nthe trend, we anticipate shrink will nonetheless materially pressure our fiscal 2024 full-year financial results.\nWe continue to implement and invest in certain strategic initiatives that we believe will help drive profitable sales\ngrowth with both new and existing customers and capture long-term growth opportunities. Such opportunities include\nproviding our customers with a variety of shopping access points and even greater value and convenience by leveraging and\ndeveloping digital tools and technology, such as our Dollar General app, which contains a variety of tools to enhance the in-\nstore shopping experience. Additionally, our partnership with a third-party delivery service is available in the majority of our\nstores, and we continue to grow our DG Media Network, which is our platform for connecting brand partners with our\ncustomers to drive even greater value for each.\nFurther, we continue to evaluate and evolve the pOpshelf concept, in light of the softer discretionary sales\nenvironment, and have continued to convert certain pOpshelf stores to Dollar General stores. pOpshelf is a unique retail\nconcept focused on categories such as seasonal and home d\u00e9cor, health and beauty, home cleaning supplies, and party and\nentertainment goods. At the end of the second quarter of 2024, we operated 229 standalone pOpshelf stores.\nOur \u201cDG Fresh\u201d initiative, a self-distribution model for frozen and refrigerated products that is designed to reduce\nproduct costs, enhance item assortment, improve our in-stock position, and enhance sales, has positively contributed to our\nsales and gross margin performance since we completed the initial rollout in 2021. Moving forward, we plan to focus on\nadditional optimization of the distribution footprint and product assortment within DG Fresh with the goal to further drive\nprofitable sales growth.\nWe also remain focused on capturing growth opportunities. In the second quarter of 2024, we opened a total of 213\nnew stores, remodeled 478 stores, and relocated 25 stores. In fiscal 2024 we plan to open approximately 730 new stores\n(including any pOpshelf stores or stores in Mexico), remodel approximately 1,620 stores, and relocate approximately 85\nstores.\nWe expect store format innovation to allow us to capture additional growth opportunities within our existing markets\nas we continue to utilize the most productive of our various Dollar General store formats based on the specific market\nopportunity. We are using two larger format stores (approximately 8,500 square feet and 9,500 square feet, respectively), and\nconsistent with 2023, expect the 8,500 square foot format, along with our existing Dollar General Plus format of a similar size,\nto continue as our base prototypes for the majority of new stores in 2024. The larger formats allow for expanded high-\ncapacity-cooler counts, an extended queue line, and a broader product assortment, including an enhanced non-consumable\noffering, a larger health and beauty section, and produce in select stores.\nWe have established a position as a low-cost operator, always seeking ways to reduce or control costs that do not\naffect our customers\u2019 shopping experiences. We plan to continue enhancing this position over time while employing ongoing\ncost discipline to reduce certain expenses as a percentage of sales. Nonetheless, we seek to maintain flexibility to invest in the\nbusiness as necessary to enhance our long-term competitiveness and profitability.

Such rule is currently the subject of pending legal\nchallenges, the outcome of which is uncertain. We do not currently expect that such rule will have a material impact on our\nfinancial results in fiscal 2024, but if implemented as currently written, it could materially increase labor costs and potentially\nhave a material negative impact on our operating results beginning in 2025. We are analyzing our alternatives to address such\novertime regulations and the resulting financial impact.\nWhile we believe the overall growth rate of inflation is continuing to moderate, ongoing inflationary pressures will\ncontinue to affect our operating results and our vendors and customers. Moreover, increases in market interest rates have had a\nnegative impact on our interest expense. Both inflation and higher interest rates have significantly increased new store\nopening costs and occupancy costs, and while we continue to have strong new store returns and plan to grow our store base\nsignificantly in 2024, these increased costs have negatively impacted our projected new store returns and influenced our 2024\nnew store growth plans.\nOur diverse teams are a competitive advantage, and we proactively seek ways to continue investing in their\ndevelopment. Our goal is to create an environment that attracts, develops, and retains talented personnel, particularly at the\nstore manager level, because employees who are promoted from within our company generally have longer tenures and are\ngreater contributors to improvements in our financial performance. We are taking actions designed to reduce our higher than\ntargeted store manager turnover, including through budgeting and allocation of labor hours, simplifying in-store activities, and\nreducing excess inventory.\nTo further enhance shareholder returns, we pay a quarterly cash dividend. The declaration and amount of future\ndividends are subject to Board discretion and approval, although we currently expect to continue paying quarterly cash\ndividends. As planned, to preserve our investment grade credit rating and maintain financial flexibility, we did not repurchase\nany shares during 2023 under our share repurchase program and do not plan to repurchase shares during 2024.\nWe utilize key performance indicators, which are defined below, in the management of our business including same-\nstore sales, average sales per square foot, and inventory turnover. We use these measures to maximize profitability and for\ndecisions about the allocation of resources. Each of these measures is commonly used by investors in retail companies to\nmeasure the health of the business.\nSame-store sales. Same-store sales are calculated based upon our stores that were open at least 13 full fiscal months\nand remain open at the end of the reporting period. We include stores that have been remodeled, expanded or\nrelocated in our same-store sales calculation. Changes in same-store sales are calculated based on the comparable 52\ncalendar weeks in the current and prior years. The method of calculating same-store sales varies across the retail\nindustry.

The nature of our business is somewhat seasonal. Primarily because of Christmas-related merchandise\nsales, operating profit in our fourth quarter (November, December and January) has historically been higher than operating\nprofit achieved in each of the first three quarters of the fiscal year. Expenses, and to a greater extent operating profit, vary by\nquarter. Results of a period shorter than a full year may not be indicative of results expected for the entire year.

SG&A was 24.6% as a percentage of net sales in the 2024 period\ncompared to 23.9% in the comparable 2023 period, an increase of 76 basis points. The primary expenses that were a higher\npercentage of net sales in the current year period were retail labor, depreciation and amortization, technology-related expenses\nand store occupancy costs.\nInterest Expense, net. Interest expense, net decreased by $26.8 million to $140.6 million in the 2024 period primarily\ndue to higher cash balances.\nIncome Taxes. The effective income tax rate for the 2024 period was 22.8% compared to a rate of 22.3% for the 2023\nperiod which represents a net increase of 50 percentage points. The tax rate for the 2024 period was higher than the\ncomparable 2023 period primarily due to an increase in the state effective rate and expense from stock-based compensation\noffset by the effect of certain rate-impacting items, such as federal tax credits, on lower earnings before taxes in the 2024\nperiod.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe believe our cash flow from operations and existing cash balances, combined with availability under the unsecured\nrevolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving Facility\u201d), the unsecured commercial paper notes (the \u201cCP Notes\u201d) and access to the\ndebt markets, will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations, projected working capital requirements, capital\nspending, and anticipated dividend payments for a period that includes the next twelve months as well as the next several\nyears. However, our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity may be affected by numerous factors, many of which are outside of\nour control. Depending on our liquidity levels, conditions in the capital markets and other factors, we may from time to time\nconsider the issuance of debt, equity or other securities, the proceeds of which could provide additional liquidity for our\noperations. All of our material borrowing arrangements are described in greater detail in Note 5 to the unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements.\nOur borrowing availability under the Revolving Facility may be effectively limited by our CP Notes as further\ndescribed in Note 5 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. For the remainder of fiscal 2024, we\nanticipate potential combined borrowings under the Revolving Facility and our CP Notes to be a maximum of approximately\n$500 million outstanding at any one time.\nCurrent Financial Condition / Recent Developments\nOur inventory balance represented approximately 46% of our total assets, exclusive of operating lease assets,\ngoodwill and other intangible assets, as of August 2, 2024. Our ability to effectively manage our inventory balances can have a\nsignificant impact on our cash flows from operations during a given fiscal year, as discussed below. Inventory purchases are\noften somewhat seasonal in nature, such as the purchase of warm-weather or Christmas-related merchandise.

Changes in merchandise inventories resulted in a\n$23.4 million decrease in the 2024 period as compared to a decrease of $817.0 million in the 2023 period as further discussed\nbelow. Changes in accounts payable resulted in a $306.3 million increase in the 2024 period compared to a $107.8 million\nincrease in the 2023 period, due primarily to the timing of inventory receipts and related payments. Changes in accrued\nexpenses resulted in a $109.8 million increase in 2024 compared to a $12.4 million decrease in 2023 due primarily to the\ntiming of accruals and payments for incentive compensation and sales tax.
